# Tracing the history of five Weddell Sea ice floes

We visited five sea ice floes with KuKa in March/April 2022.

The purpose of the code in this repository is to plot the positions of the floes, and learn about how they reached that point. In particular, we would like to know *where* they came from, *what* weather they had experienced, *how* much snowfall they had seed, and *when* they experienced freeze-up.

Also in the repo is code to compare average snowfall amounts over sea ice, in the Arctic, the Antarctic, and in the Weddell Sea specifically. Doing this allows us to compare the snowfall that our five floes saw with what would "typically" be experienced in Antarctica at-large, and also within the Arctic.
